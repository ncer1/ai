1. Write a Python in Prolog calculate addition of two no. 
# Addition of two numbers
x = int(input("Enter first number: "))
y = int(input("Enter second number: "))

z = x + y
print("Addition =", z)

2. Write a Python in Prolog to find Maximum of two no . 

# Maximum of two numbers
x = int(input("Enter first number: "))
y = int(input("Enter second number: "))

if x >= y:
    print("Maximum =", x)
else:
    print("Maximum =", y)

3. Write a Python in Prolog that take number N from the user and count from N to 10. 

# Count from N to 10
n = int(input("Enter N: "))

for i in range(n, 11):
    print(i)

4. Write a Python in Prolog that take number N from the user and count from N to 1. 

# Count from N to 1
n = int(input("Enter N: "))

for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    print(i)

5. Write a Python in Prolog that take number N from the user calculate factorial of no. 

# Factorial of N
n = int(input("Enter N: "))

fact = 1
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    fact *= i

print("Factorial =", fact)

6. Write a Python in Prolog that take number N from the user calculate square of no from N to 20 and display it.

# Square from N to 20
n = int(input("Enter N: "))

for i in range(n, 21):
    print(f"{i}^2 =", i * i)
